Shader Pack #01 (Cartoon landscape shader pack)

Welcome!
...and thanks for buying this outstanding shader pack :)

On this small tutorial you will find all the necessary details to configure the shaders and prepare your meshes to create amazing videogame grahics.


PREPARING YOUR MESHES:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to use this shader properly on your meshes you should prepare the so they can handle the shader and display their properties as expected:

WATER SHADER:
	Shader(s):
		sh_fx_SOLID_cartoonWater 	(meant for solid flat water surfaces (without transparency))
		
	To prepare your mesh for the shader usage you should paint the water mesh using vertex colour:
	- Paint in BLACK the edges of the water body.

WATER STREAM/WATERFALL:
	Shader(s):
		sh_fx_SOLID_cartoonWaterFall	(meant for rivers, waterfalls or water streams)
		
	To prepare your mesh for the shader usage you should paint the water mesh using vertex colour:
	- Paint in RED the vertices that belong to the river and leave in black those that belong to the waterfall
	- Paint in GREEN the vertices of the edge of the river/waterfall

WATER RIPPLES:
	shader(s):
		sh_fx_ADD_cartoonWaterRipples		(additive version)
		sh_fx_CUTOUT_cartoonWaterRipples	(alpha test version)
		
	To prepare your mesh for the shader usage you should paint the water mesh using vertex colour:
	- Paint in WHITE the are where you want the ripples to be visible.
	- Leave in BLACK the rest.
	- You can use this shader to emulate the waterfall foam too.

MOVING GRASS/FOLIAGE:
	Shader(s):
		sh_fx_CUTOUT_vegetationMoving		(meant for "alpha" vegetation)
		sh_fx_SOLID_vegetationMoving		(meant for "solid" vegetation)
		
	For Moving plants or grass it is required to paint your meshes with VERTEX COLOUR so you can control their movement.
	- Paint in RED those parts that you want to move. 
	- Keep in BLACK those areas that you want still.
	- Alternatively, you can add other colours too (BLUE / GREEN) in order to add randomness to the movement.

TERRAIN/PROP (triplanar shader):
	Shader(s):
		sh_regular_SOLID_groundWorldCoords_terrain		(meant for flat ground. it doesn't require UVs !!)
		sh_regular_SOLID_groundWorldCoords_props		(meant for "irregular" terrain. it can be VC masked)
		
	It doesn't require any kind of preparation, however on the "prop" version you can limit the "grass" effect through B/W vertex colour masking.

BONUS: MOVING FLAG SHADER:
	Shader(s):
		sh_fx_CUTOUT_flagAnimVert
		
	To prepare your mesh for the shader usage you should paint the water mesh using vertex colour:
	- Red channel: It allows the flag to move (red = full movement / Black = still)
	- Green+Blue channels: They add “randomness” to the movement of the flag.
